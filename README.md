# OS Development Shenanigans
> Messing around with bootloader and kernel development.

This repository will hold the code that I write
while learning exactly what happens when you press
the power button.

I'll have some broken code, working code, and maybe
some code you can boot yourself, that resembles the
the birth of an operating system.

I'll also have *many* comments, as well as papers
on what things are doing, and why. This repository
is for my own learning sake, and maybe you'll find
some useful information here as well!
